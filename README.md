# Infrastructural-Development-using-Satellite-Imagery

Abstract:
Conventional approaches of evaluating infrastructure development, such field studies and hand-based inspection, are sometimes spatially constrained, expensive, and time-consuming. This work presents a novel framework combining machine learning with satellite images to map and track infrastructure development across wide areas. By means of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on multispectral satellite pictures, the model can identify and classify important infrastructure elements including roads, buildings, and utility networks. Providing a strong substitute for standard infrastructure monitoring methods, the system shows great scalability, accuracy, and real-time application. Our findings highlight the need of satellite-based deep learning systems for initiatives on sustainable development, urban planning, and development analysis.
