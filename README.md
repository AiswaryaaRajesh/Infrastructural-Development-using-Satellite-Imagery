# Infrastructural-Development-using-Satellite-Imagery

Conventional approaches to evaluating infrastructure development, such as field studies and hand-based inspection, are sometimes spatially constrained, expensive, and time-consuming. This work presents a novel framework combining machine learning with satellite images to map and track infrastructure development across wide areas. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on multispectral satellite pictures, the model can identify and classify essential infrastructure elements including roads, buildings, and utility networks. The system provides a strong substitute for standard infrastructure monitoring methods and shows great scalability, accuracy, and real-time application. Our findings highlight the need for satellite-based deep learning systems for initiatives on sustainable development, urban planning, and development analysis.
